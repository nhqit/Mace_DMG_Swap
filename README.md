# MaceDMGSwap

MaceDMGSwap is a lightweight NeoForge combat mod for Minecraft 1.21.1.
It combines two ideas into one fast workflow:

- Wurst-style mace damage spoofing (fake fall packets)
- Automatic swap from sword or axe to mace and back

The goal is simple: keep your normal weapon in hand, but still land mace-style burst damage when conditions are met.

## Key Features

- Toggleable with a keybind. Default key is `V`
- Works with sword and axe auto-swap logic
- Detects mace in hotbar slots 1 to 9
- Sends Wurst-style fake-fall packet sequence for mace damage boost
- Instant flow: swap -> fake fall -> hit -> swap back
- Clean implementation with minimal overhead
- Small status overlay, no heavy UI
- PvP-oriented behavior

## Current Behavior

When the mod is enabled and you attack a living target:

1. If you already hold a mace, it applies fake-fall packets before the hit.
2. If you hold a sword or axe and a mace is in the hotbar, it swaps to mace, applies fake-fall packets at hit timing, attacks, then swaps back.

The packet sequence follows the Wurst-style pattern:

- `0`
- `0`
- `0`
- `0`
- `sqrt(500)`
- `0`

## Controls

- `V` toggles MaceDMGSwap on and off

The mod logs state changes as `ENABLED` and `DISABLED`.
